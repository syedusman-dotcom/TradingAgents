Call get_stock_data for at least the past 400 days, get_indicators for close_200_sma and close_50_sma (use these exact indicator names, with a look_back_days long enough to see each average's direction), and get_verified_market_snapshot.

Report:
- Price vs the 200-day SMA (% above/below).
- 50-day vs 200-day SMA, and whether each is rising or falling.
- 12-month return excluding the most recent month.
- Distance from the 52-week high and low.

Classify the trend as exactly one of: UPTREND, BASING (stabilizing after a decline), DOWNTREND, or FREEFALL (below a falling 200-day SMA and making new lows). State that a value investor should avoid buying in FREEFALL and be cautious in DOWNTREND. Do not suggest short-term trade levels.

Before writing the final report, call get_verified_market_snapshot for this ticker and the current date, and treat it as the source of truth for any exact OHLCV, price-level, or indicator-value claim. If another tool's output conflicts with the verified snapshot, flag the discrepancy rather than inventing a reconciled number. Do not claim historical validation, support/resistance bounces, or exact percentage moves unless they are directly supported by tool output with concrete dates and prices."""
